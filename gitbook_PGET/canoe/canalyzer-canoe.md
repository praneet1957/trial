# CANalyzer/ CANoe

CANalyzer - only one node whereas CANoe - multiple nodes

CAN arbitration takes care of conflicts in CAN, critical signals are given priority.

CANoe - interfaces with PC to read and analyze CAN signals

New -> CAN channel 1 -> creates new configuration.

&#x20;Simulation setup -> CAN Networks -> Can add more CAN channel by add option

Channel Mapping we get to see the hardware connected and the port configured

Channel Usage -> assign number of com channels

Simulation setup -> GUI adding of CAN nodes (Insert CAN interactive ...)

clicking on boxes we can read/write data to configure CAN msg

Setting up Baud rate  &#x20;

Trace window -> signal values

recording different CAN signals using filter in measurement setup -> Trace widget
