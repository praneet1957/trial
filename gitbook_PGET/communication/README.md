# Communication

Automotive communication protocols provide a standardized way for different systems in a vehicle to communicate with each other. These protocols can improve performance, reliability, and safety

Some of the common protocols are

* UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/ Transmitter)
* I2C (Inter-Integrated circuits)
* SPI (serial peripheral interface)
* LIN (Local Interconnect Network)
* CAN (Controller Area Network)
* Flex-Ray
* Ethernet
