Based on different hardware setup there are 2 types of Hardware.

* PHS is used to establish a communication link between a processor board and I/O boards. PHS can support multiple I/O boards for a processor board.
* The dSPACE SCALEXIO system is a modular system that can be used for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) and rapid control prototyping (RCP) applications.
