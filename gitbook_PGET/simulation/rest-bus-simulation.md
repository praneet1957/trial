# Rest Bus Simulation

Rest bus simulation is a technique used to test devices on communication networks like CAN, The goal is to test the device under test by simulating the absent network participants, it has various benefits

* Rest bus simulation can be used to test individual electronic control units (ECUs) independently of the other ECUs in a vehicle
* Can be used to test the entire networks and their functionalities
